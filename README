INTRODUCTION
============

The svnmailer is a tool, which is usually called by a subversion hook
to submit commit notifications in various ways (at the moment: mail via
SMTP or a pipe to a sendmail like program, news via NNTP, CIA live
tracker notification via XML-RPC). It is derived from the original
mailer.py distributed with subversion, but supposed to be much more
consistent, better extensible and to have much more features. Have a
look at the documentation for further details.

INSTALLATION
============

$ python setup.py install

Make sure, you meet the system requirements before putting it into
production mode.


SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS:
====================

In order to use the svnmailer, you need to have subversion >= 1.0 and the
subversion python bindings installed. Further you need python 2.3 or later.
The code is supposed to run with subversion 1.0.x, 1.1.x and 1.2.x.

The svnmailer was written for POSIX and Win32 systems.

So far, it's tested on
 * Gentoo Linux / svn 1.0.9     / python 2.3
 * Gentoo Linux / svn 1.1.1     / python 2.3
 * Gentoo Linux / svn 1.1.3     / python 2.3
 * Gentoo Linux / svn 1.2.0     / python 2.3
 * SuSE 9.1     / svn 1.1.1     / python 2.3
 * FreeBSD 4.11 / svn 1.1.2     / python 2.4
 * FreeBSD 4.11 / svn 1.1.4     / python 2.4
 * Windows 2000 / svn 1.1.3     / python 2.3


DOCUMENTATION
=============

You'll find a user documentation in the docs/ directory of the
distribution package (index.html). Further, there's the code
documentation, generated by epydoc (<http://epydoc.sourceforge.net/>).
The docs are currently not installed. The documentation is also available
online at <http://opensource.perlig.de/svnmailer/>.


GETTING STARTED
===============

After the installation, first make sure that the mailer works in general.
The following command gives you the version of the svnmailer and the svn
version it uses. If this does not crash (which may happen on missing
subversion bindings), chances are good, that the installation was successful:
$ svn-mailer --version

In order to let the svnmailer do some real work, you need to create a
configuration file and then configure your repository properly to actually
use the mailer. This is described in great detail in the documentation.


TESTING
=======

A (still incomplete) test suite is available as an extra package
(svnmailer_test). This test package needs to be downloaded seperatly.


BUGS
====

No bugs, of course. But if you've found one, send me a mail ;-)
