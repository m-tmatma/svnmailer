CONFIGURATION SAMPLES
=====================

In this directory the impatient will find some configuration
files and hook examples. You'll find some explaining comments
inside. But don't forget to glance over the documentation anyway :)


CONFIGS
=======

* simple.conf:
  A really simple config. Just enter your mail address there und you're done.

* groups.conf:
  Just to show, how different paths in a repository may be prepared for
  notifications to different people

* advanced.conf (passwords.txt, authors.txt):
  More complex config (with supplemental files), which maintains different
  repositories, groups within these repositories, different notification
  formats, option mapping and more.


HOOKS
=====

The hooks/ subdirectory contains hooks for all possible svnmailer notification
modes. The files without extension are bash scripts. The files with the .bat
extension are for Windows users.

Have fun!
