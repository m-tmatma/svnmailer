Changes with version 1.0.0

 *) Evaluate svn:mime-type when looking for file encodings

 *) Add configuration option to define whether the content charset
    should be shown in the diff header (show_applied_charset)

 *) Provide configurable handling of paths that do not belong to
    the matched group (show_nonmatching_paths option)

 *) Make subjects more flexible by providing configurable templates

 *) Add revision and property general substitution keywords

 *) Fix common path prefix computation, which didn't work correctly in
    certain cases

 *) Subversion 1.2 is fully supported now (python bindings and locking)

 *) The command line interface now only accepts the options suitable
    for the svn version used

 *) svn-mailer --version now puts also the svn version it uses

 *) Cleanup L10N code. The unicode support (especially for file names)
    should work much better now. This introduces some differences to
    the semantics of non-7bit command lines

 *) Allow included config file names to contain spaces by using
    the same rules as the command line parser

 *) Allow mapping sections to be used for more than one option

 *) [default] config entries are no longer (pre-mapped) twice

 *) Add the revision number to development releases

 *) Separate svnmailer._test from svnmailer

 *) Update suppressed pylint messages to pylint 0.6.4 and modify
    some code parts to not crash pylint

 *) Fix memory leak on subversion access

 *) Add support for old-style propchange2 subcommand CLI

 *) Refactor the svnmailer.struct code in order to make it better
    extensible, maintainable and reusable for other projects.

 *) Display the original charset of files, when they are recoded to UTF-8

 *) Add the possibility to limit the number of mails sent (on splitted
    notifications)

 *) Fix typo, which lead to a crash, when extract_x509_author was active

 *) Add the possibility to configure websvn as repository browser

 *) Add infrastructure to configure repository browsers different from
    viewcvs. The viewcvs_base_url option is now deprecated in favour of
    browser_base_url.

 *) CIA notifier: add trailing slash to directories, so they are not
    counted twice. Further update to the latest features: 'action' and
    'type' attributes for files (the latter currently just types
    directories as 'x-directory/normal' and leaves real files untouched).

 *) Apply clear semantics for overlong revprop change notifications by
    extending the long_mail_action and long_news_action options

 *) Allow notification mails to be constructed as multipart mails using
    binary transfer encoding for the diffs

 *) Prefix repository absolute paths with slashes in the subject

 *) Support the svn 1.2 features of being able to generate diffs on
    revprop changes.

 *) The split long mail action no longer clobbers the propchange output.

 *) Recognize if a property is a translated one (unicode) or not.

 *) generate_diffs: Configuring explicitly empty is now the same as
    generate_diffs = none

 *) Allow the diff_command option to be placed in group configuration
    sections. diff_command in [general] is now deprecated.

 *) Allow configured viewcvs URLs to contain parameters (like the project
    root)

 *) Suppress viewcvs diff urls on directories (which are not supported by
    viewcvs)

 *) Hyphens in option names now are replaced with underscores before
    being processed. That allow a more lenient behaviour of the config
    parser.

 *) The content transfer encoding is now configurable

 *) Add ability to map certain config values

 *) The maximum subject length is now configurable

 *) Allow for config file inclusion

 *) Allow the config file name to be '-', meaning STDIN.

 *) Deleted files now get the proper viewcvs URL

 *) Add the ability to configure the content charset of files via
    properties (apply_charset_property option)

 *) If the log entry doesn't end with a newline, append one

 *) Introduce much better performance for huge mails in conclusion
    with quoted-printable encoding (by using the binascii C module)

 *) Add news notifier (submitting via NNTP)

 *) The directory used for temporary files is now configurable
 
 *) Add the group name to the substitution dict

 *) Add overlong mail handling. (long_mail_action configuration option)

 *) Win32 is now fully supported.

 *) Add XML-RPC notifier for the CIA project (http://cia.navi.cx/)

 *) Add the ability to treat the author string as x509 subject and extract
    real name and mail address from it.

 *) Add the ability to supply a custom header for better filtering

Changes with version 0.9.9

 *) Fix reply_to_addr, which didn't work at all.

Changes with version 0.9.8

 *) Initialize the substitution dict with the named groups of the
    default for_repos and for_paths options.

 *) No longer hide a traceback in non-dev versions

Changes with version 0.9.7

 *) Fix bug in path label selection, which led to a crash

Changes with version 0.9.6

 *) Add debug_all_mails_to option to send the mail not to the
    selected recipients, but some fixed folks

Changes with version 0.9.5

 *) Add user documentation

Changes with version 0.9.4

 *) Use the base path for the 'from' file on copy diffs

 *) Use "no_author" in substitution dict if no author could be determined

 *) Improve error handling

 *) If there are no groups, use the defaults as the one and only

 *) Accept old style command lines as well

 *) No longer choke on empty recipient address lists

Changes with version 0.9.3

 *) Write determined config errors to stderr instead of falling
    through to the "crashed" message

 *) Fix NameError in the svn-mailer script, which happened, when
    the mailer crashed

 *) make sure that test/tmp is packed into the tarball

 *) Add missing entries of previous versions in the CHANGES file

Changes with version 0.9.2

 *) Include svnmailer._test.suite.notifier in the list of packages
    in setup.py

Changes with version 0.9.1

 *) Remove the __init__.py from the test directory, which
    was copied there by accident

 *) Fix generation of the MANIFEST file, which listed the test
    directory contents in one line

Changes with version 0.9.0

 *) First beta release
    It should have all features of the original mailer.py
